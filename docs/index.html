  <ul class="content-width features">
    <li>

      <h2>
        Perfectly productive
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wisp is simple, type safe, and entirely free from confusing magic. Make
        development as stress-free as possible whether you're starting a new
        prototype or maintaining a large system.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>
        Flipping fast
      </h2>
      <p>
        Thanks to the Mist HTTP server and the mighty multithreaded BEAM
        runtime Wisp applications are fast, even at the 99th percentile during a
        big burst of traffic. In benchmarks Wisp can outperform Go, NodeJS, and
        Elixir Phoenix + Cowboy.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>
        Totally testable
      </h2>
      <p>
        If your application matters then you're going to want to test it. A Wisp
        web application is as easy to test as any regular Gleam function, and an
        assortment of useful test helpers are provided to keep your tests
        concise.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>
        Really reliable
      </h2>
      <p>
        Scrambling to fix problems in production is stressful, so Wisp uses
        Gleam's type safety and the BEAM's fault tolerance help prevent those
        panicked late night phone calls from your boss.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <section class="content-width">
    <h2>OK, but what does Wisp actually give you?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Composable middleware, with lots of useful ones built-in.</li>
      <li>Type safe routing with good old fashioned pattern matching.</li>
      <li>Parsing of JSON, urlencoded, and multipart bodies.</li>
      <li>Tamper-proof signed cookies, suitable for authentication.</li>
      <li>Body size limiting and file upload streaming to disc, to prevent
        memory exhaustion attacks.</li>
      <li>Serving of CSS, JavaScript, or whatever other static assets you want.</li>
      <li>Logging, both ad-hoc logging and request logging, using a middleware.</li>
      <li>Regular Gleam programming, so you can use any Gleam package you want
        without trouble.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And a recommended project structure, so you can focus on solving the
      problems you want to solve, rather than reinventing the wheel.
    </p>

    <h2>That sounds good! What does it look like?</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a JSON API request handler that saves an item in a database.
    </p>
    <pre><code>import my_app/people
import my_app/web.{Context}
import gleam/result.{try}
import wisp.{Request, Response}

pub fn handle_request(req: Request, ctx: Context) -> Response {
  use json <- wisp.require_json(req)

  let result = {
    use params <- try(people.parse_params(json))
    use person <- try(people.save(params, ctx.db))
    Ok(people.to_json(person))
  }

  case result {
    Ok(body) -> wisp.json_response(body, 201)
    Error(_) -> wisp.bad_request()
  }
}
</code></pre>

# Wisp Example: Configuring default responses

```sh
gleam run   # Run the server
gleam test  # Run the tests
```

Wisp has a response body value called `Empty`, which is just that: an empty
body. It can be returned by middleware functions such as `wisp.require_json`
when the request isn't suitable for request handler to run, such as if the
request body contains invalid JSON.

You likely want your application to return a generic error page rather than an empty body, and this example shows how to do that.

This example is based off of the ["routing" example][routing] so read that first.
The additions are detailed here and commented in the code.

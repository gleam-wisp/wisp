# Wisp Example: Reading form data

```sh
gleam run   # Run the server
gleam test  # Run the tests
```

This example shows how to read urlencoded and multipart formdata from a request

This example is based off of the ["Hello, World!" example][hello], and uses
concepts from the [routing example][routing] so read those first. The additions
are detailed here and commented in the code.
